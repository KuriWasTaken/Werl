# Werl
Werl Is a half done programing language written in lua
Please don't steal my code, use it as a source of learning or just modify it to fit your needs.

Need to fix:
For some reason sometimes if statements are not working.
I was lazy and didn't finish for loops. Either wait for me to add it or you can add it yourself as I have already added tables(arrays) as a data type.
