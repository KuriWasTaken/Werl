# Werl
Werl Is a half done programing language written in lua
Please don't steal my code, use it as a source of learning or just modify it to fit your needs.

Need to fix:
For some reason sometimes if statements are not working.
I was lazy and didn't finish for loops. Either wait for me to add it or you can add it yourself as I have already added tables(arrays) as a data type.

Also for some reason "arg[1]" is not working in lua. Might have something to do with me running it in lua 5.1 Anyways this means that it gets the script from a file called "ballz.werl" This is only mentioned once in the code near io.open so you can change code path or try it with "arg[1]" so it uses command line arguments!

I should also make the code a bit prettier by making functions in to separate files.

I also gotta add if else statements. Should hopefully be pretty easy
